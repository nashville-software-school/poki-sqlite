# Poems By Kids SQL Practice
The Poems By Kids database includes a large number of poems by children in various grades, associates with various emotions. Your task in the following exercises is to learn more about those poems using SQL queries.

## Setup 
Because this database is large, the database file, with all of the tables and rows you will need, has already been created for you and is included in this repo. You _do not need to run the sql script included in this repo_, but you should look at the first part of it to understand the structure of the database. Use that script to create an ERD for Poems By Kids that you can reference while working on the queries. Create a file called `solutions.sql` to store the answers to the questions.
